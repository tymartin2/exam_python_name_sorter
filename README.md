# Python Name Sorter Script

Given a set of names in a csv file, you are required to reorder the rows by last name, then by any given names the person may
have. Each row will consist of at least 1 last name and may have up to 3 given names. You are required to write a Python script to
read the csv file and output the sorted result into another csv file.

## Usage
